What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

For a long time, my Visual studio code failed, despite trying to fix the issues. This slowed down my progress and my attempts to get better in python oop because I felt discouraged. Yet, I later changed the IDE and was able to practice and make some improvement. 

The first advice I would give someone would be seeking help and being open to trying different resources when the popular ones are not working, because it would be better to figure out what works better for someone and use that. Also, setting enough time to work on the assignments rather than last minutes pressure helps.
